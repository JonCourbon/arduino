# JSONCommunication_Processing
Processing sends a message in JSON format to Arduino in order to switch on/off the LED 13
Arduino executes the action and sends back the number of times it switches on LED 13
- For Arduino code => use aJson library: https://github.com/interactive-matter/aJson
- For Processing code => use JSON4processing library: https://github.com/agoransson/JSON-processing

Additional elements in the messages have been added for example purpose.
